                </div>
                <p>The Netherlands may not have the variety of cheeses you’d see in a country like France, but that doesn’t mean the supply of cheese is lacking.</p>
                
                <p> The Netherlands and Amsterdam are synonymous with one cheese– Gouda– one of the oldest cheeses in the world still made today.</p>
                
                <p>The Dutch do love their Gouda and you will find it everywhere. While gouda is of course readily available in the US as well as most of the world, you probably won’t find the different types of gouda available directly at the source.</p>
                
                <p>Visit any local cheese shop for unlimited samples of different variations on gouda to take home the perfect wheel.Henri Willig shops, located in central Amsterdam, are particularly tourist friendly, with experts on hand to explain the cheese making process.Gouda is typically sold by age. But some local cheese shops (like Henri Willig) also offer some unique flavor combinations like coconut, cumin, chili pepper and sparkling wine.</p>

                <img src="stroopwafel-amsterdam.jpg" alt="stroopwafel" class="image3">
                </div>
                <p>The popular stroopwafels (a wafer waffle) are a traditional Dutch snack. This waffle consists of two thin layers of cookie dough with a layer of caramel in the middle. Stroopwafels were first made in the city of Gouda in the late 18th century by a baker named Gerard Kamphuisen. According to the oldest recipe ever found, this waffle is made from crumbs left over from making cookies. The ingredients to make these cakes are so cheap that they are often considered poor man’s cookies. Today, stroopwafels are not just a popular Dutch snack but also loved by many visitors, they often buy them to eat as well as to give as gifts.</p>

                <p>Delftware (also known as Delft Blue) is blue and white glazed pottery that originated in the Delft region of the Netherlands around the 16th century. Today, these pottery and porcelain products are not only available in Delft but you can find Delft pottery everywhere in the Netherlands, even throughout Europe. This Dutch pottery are produced in many different shapes and sizes, patterns, designs… from plates, jars, vases to ceramic figurines, paintings, souvenir items… Pottery items will make great souvenirs for those who love pottery.</p>

            <div class='bicycle'>
                <h2>Bicycle-related Souvenir</h2>
                <div class="image5">
                <img src="bicycle.jpg" alt="bicle-related"  class="image5">
                </div>
                <p>The Dutch take their cycling seriously it is a means of transport in any weather, any time of day or night, sometimes with a child in the backseat (or as I witnessed, even in the front clutching the handlebars). You might have this storybook visual of charming Amsterdam bustling with cyclists leisurely pedaling in perfect harmony with the pedestrians. This visual would be completely wrong.In Amsterdam, there is no such thing as leisure biking, at least not on the street’s ubiquitous bike paths. The Dutch are fast and nimble cyclists. But make no mistake, pedestrians do not have right of way here. You would think that as long as you steer clear of the bike paths (not optional, do not walk aimlessly into them) you would be safe from collisions. But cyclists sometimes end up on the sidewalk. Or the sidewalk might be blocked and the only route around is on the bike path. I also found that cyclists routinely disregard street lights and signs so pay careful attention when crossing the street.  They can creep up on you out of nowhere. As you might expect, a city (and country) so dedicated to cycling is going to have some pretty interesting bicycles and cycling paraphenalia. While a bike might be a tricky Amsterdam souvenir to bring home, there are plenty of more portable options. I loved these colorful painted bike bells, easy to bring home and the perfect fit for any bike.</p>

            <div class='pie'>
                <h2>Slice of Dutch Apple Pie</h2>

                <img src="Applepie.jpg" alt="apple-pie" class="image6">
                </div>
                <p>Dutch apple pie is different from the American pastry variety. Its cake-like texture is sweet, crumbly and crunchy– an addictive combination.Granted, apple pie might be trickier to bring home, but worth it for the dedicated. Winkel Cafe is the place to go for their celebrated Dutch apple pie.</p>

                <img src="Dutch-Licorice-1.jpg" alt="dutch-pie" class="image7">
                </div>
                <p>Licorice is one of the Dutch people’s most loved herbs. Licorice is a commonly flavored and black confection with the main ingredient being extracted from the root of the licorice plant (Glycyrrhiza glabra). The Netherlands is one of the countries with the highest consumption of licorice in the world.You can find a wide variety of licorice in Dutch grocery and confectionery stores, from sweet to savory, from honey to mint falovers, from marshmallows to hard candies… There are countless types for you to choose according to your liking.Among the candy shops in the Netherlands, Het Oud-Hollandsch Snoepwinkeltje (Address: Tweede Egelantiersdwarsstraat 2, 1015 SC Amsterdam, Netherlands/Hours: 11AM–5PM/Monday; Sunday: Closed) is one of the oldest one. If you can’t go to Het Oud-Hollandsch Snoepwinkeltje, try coming to the Jamin candy store chain with locations all over Amsterdam. In addition, Blaak market is also famous for its stalls displaying all kinds of traditional Dutch confectionery.</p>

            <h3>AMSTERDAM</h3>
            <div class="image9">
            <img src="Amsterdam.jpg" alt="amsterdam" class="center">
            <p>Amsterdam, city and port, western Netherlands, located on the IJsselmeer and connected to the North Sea. It is the capital and the principal commercial and financial centre of the Netherlands.</P>
            <br>
            <p>To the scores of tourists who visit each year, Amsterdam is known for its historical attractions, for its collections of great art, and for the distinctive colour and flavour of its old sections, which have been so well preserved. However, visitors to the city also see a crowded metropolis beset by environmental pollution, traffic congestion, and housing shortages. It is easy to describe Amsterdam, which is more than 700 years old, as a living museum of a bygone age and to praise the eternal beauty of the centuries-old canals, the ancient patrician houses, and the atmosphere of freedom and tolerance, but the modern city is still working out solutions to the pressing urban problems that confront it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Amsterdam is the nominal capital of the Netherlands but not the seat of government, which is The Hague. The royal family, for example, is only occasionally in residence at the Royal Palace, on the square known as the Dam, in Amsterdam. The city lacks the monumental architecture found in other capitals. There are no wide squares suitable for big parades, nor are there triumphal arches or imposing statues. Amsterdam’s intimate character is best reflected in the narrow, bustling streets of the old town, where much of the population still goes about its business. While there are reminders of the glorious past—gabled houses, noble brick facades clad with sandstone, richly decorated cornices, towers and churches, and the music of carillons and barrel organs—the realities of life in the modern city often belie this romantic image.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The inner city is divided by its network of canals into some 90 “islands,” and the municipality contains approximately 1,300 bridges and viaducts. Amsterdam is the economic centre of the Netherlands, and there tradition persists alongside innovation. Although the city has a modern metro system, about one-fifth of the workforce still relies on the time-honoured bicycle for transportation. The city continues to be famous for its countless Chinese and Indonesian restaurants and the hundreds of houseboats that line its canals. Since the mid-1960s Amsterdam also has been known for a permissive atmosphere, and it attracts many people seeking an alternative lifestyle. Area city, 64 square miles (165 square km); metro. area, 245 square miles (635 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) city, 1,028,603; metro. area, 1,482,676.</p>
