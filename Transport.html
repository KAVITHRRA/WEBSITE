            <p>In a country as richly endowed with waterways as Holland, public transport by water is an important feature. So it makes sense that Holland features various ferry services to take you from A to B.</p>
            <h2>The Amsterdam ferry</h2>
            <p>Several ferry lines and water taxis operate in and around Amsterdam, such as the ferries that cross the IJ River from Amsterdam Central Station (back entrance) to the district of Amsterdam-Noord. If you want to visit the EYE Film Museum, for instance, take the ferry from Central Station to Buiksloterweg. The ferries in Amsterdam are free of charge. Departure times are specified on notice boards at the dock. </p>
            <h2>Water taxis</h2>
            <p>If you want to get around in Rotterdam in a quick and out-of-the-ordinary way, give Watertaxi Rotterdam a try. Watertaxi Rotterdam has about 50 stops in Rotterdam and the surrounding area and is not just fast but offers a fantastic way to experience Rotterdam from the water as well. Fares depend on the size of your group and the distance, so inquire about the possibilities beforehand.Amsterdam also has a water taxi service, which transports you over the city's canals quickly and comfortably. You can board the water taxi in several locations throughout the city. The main station can be found at the VVV tourist office on Stationsplein square at Amsterdam Central Station. The tourist office can provide more information about the service schedule and rates.</p>
            <h2>Waterbus Rotterdam & Dordrecht</h2>
            <div>
                <img src="waterbus.jpg" alt="waterbus" class="image2">
            </div>
            <p>The Waterbus is a quick service between Rotterdam and Dordrecht. This is a paid service; you can use an anonymous OV-chipkaart (smart card) or a single-use chip card. You can bring your bicycle free of charge. Please note that the Waterbus has different summer and winter schedules, so you should inquire about current departure times.</p>

            <p>The bus, tram, and metro are great ways to travel in Dutch cities. They are highly affordable, and Holland’s excellent infrastructure allows you to get from A to B easily and comfortably.</p>
            <h2>Bus</h2>
            <p>There are extensive city and regional bus lines in Holland. This means that, wherever you are in Holland, there are bus services that will take you to most places, quickly and affordably. While bus companies vary per region, the connections are generally excellent, so you can reach your destination quickly. You will need a valid ticket to travel by bus: a single-use chip card or an anonymous OV-chipkaart (smart card). Single-use chip cards can also be bought on the bus, but that usually costs more.</p>
            <h2>Metro</h2>
            <p>In addition to trams and buses, the cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam also offer a metro service. These are usually affordable as well and generally faster than trams. The metro takes you from Duivendrecht railway station to the very centre of Amsterdam within minutes, for instance. In Rotterdam, you can travel to Blijdorp Zoo or the port of Rotterdam. The Randstadrail network (a combination of metro, train and tram) even takes you to The Hague Central Station. You will need a valid ticket to travel by metro: a single-use chip card or an anonymous OV-chipkaart. You can also buy a single-use chip card from a ticket machine at the metro stations.</p>

            <p>Most flight passengers rate the Amsterdam airport of Schiphol because it's extremely easy to reach with public transport, and because of its modern architecture, good service and high experience factor. At Schiphol Airport - as well as taking off, landing and making a pit stop - you also have great opportunities for shopping, going out, relaxing and... even visiting a museum!</p>
            <h2>Practical info for Schiphol Airport</h2>
            <p>Getting to Schiphol by public transport: Schiphol Station is located directly under the airport buildings. The train will get you to the Hague in half an hour, and Amsterdam Central Station in a quarter of an hour. Tip: the Holland Travel Ticket, which you can use to travel throughout Holland by train, tram, bus and metro all day.</p>
            <p>Of course, you can also drive to Schiphol Airport by car and leave your car at one of the many parking lots there. There's a short stay parking lot (up to 48 hours) and one for longer stays (holiday parking). If you'd like to leave your car at Schiphol Airport for more than three days, you can use the P3 parking area and get the free bus to the airport building from there. Tip: reserve your parking place online and save costs.</p>
            <p>Do you just want to drop someone off at the airport? Then use the 'kiss & ride' area in front of Departure Lounge 2.</p>
            <p>You can also take a taxi to or from the Amsterdam airport. The taxi stand is well signposted within the terminal. A trip from the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum to Schiphol Airport costs at least €30.</p>
            <p>There are three terminal buildings at Schiphol Airport: Hall 1 for flights within the Schengen area, Hall 2 for flights within and outside the Schengen area, and Hall 3 for non-Schengen flights and low-cost airlines (also Schengen flights). You can find a floor plan of the airport buildings and parking lots on the Schiphol website.</p>
